## Description 
This is a hands on course that crams as much as possible into half a day and is a compressed version of the three day course. Many of the labs and exercises in the three day course are reduced to "follow along" examples. The lab exercise essentially ties together everything throughout the workshop into a small one page application.

This is geared towards the advanced beginner who has heard of node.js but hasn't had a chance to try it out. The goal is to provide an immersion experience that will enable attendees to be up and running with node.js very quickly with a direction charted for them to continue growing as a node.js developer. Many of the important components that set node.js apart from other development platforms are covered.
